ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am [Paul](https://paulmueser.de). I am a computer science student at **Paderborn University** since 2022.

Here on GitHub, you can find my personal projects.  
I mostly develop with Python, Java, C# and JavaScript using Visual Studio Code or the JetBrains IDEAs, but I also try out a lot of new things here.

For cool project ideas you can write me [here](mailto:kontakt@paulmueser.de?subject=[Project%20Idea]%20Idea). You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-mÃ¼ser/).
